        <p id="About"> A hotel is a commercial establishment that provides lodging, meals, and other services to guests,
            travelers,
            and tourists. Hotels can range from small family-run businesses to large international chains. Most hotels
            list a variety of services, such as room service, laundry, and concierge. Some hotels also offer meeting and
            conference facilities, fitness centers, and spas.

            As a commercial enterprise, hotels are also dependent on advertising and on potential customers becoming
            aware of their hotel and booking it. Therefore, most hotels are also represented on the Internet. Often with
            their own website and on hotel search and booking portals as well as on blogs, yellow pages and online
            industry directories. Here it is important to present the hotel appealingly and to provide it with good
            descriptions of hotels.</p>
